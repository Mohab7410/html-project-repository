<h2>Coronavirus World Map: We've Now Passed The 170 Million Mark For Infections
</h2>

<h3>In late January 2020 only a few dozen COVID-19 infections had been identified outside of China. Now the virus has spread to every corner of the globe. More than 170 million infections have been reported worldwide, and the death toll is above 3.5 million, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.

The United States has far more COVID cases and deaths than any other country. India and Brazil have the second and third highest tally of cases respectively.

Explore the chart below to find a country-by-country breakdown of new and total cases since January 2020.</h3>
  
  
  <h2>
Who has vaccinated the most?</h2>

<h3> 
Several coronavirus vaccines have been approved for use, either by individual countries or groups of countries, such as the European Union and the World Health Organization (WHO).

Of the 190 countries and territories administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, 67 are high-income nations, 100 are middle-income and 23 low-income.

The map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.
